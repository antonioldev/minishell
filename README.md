# minishell

In Minishell, the 8th project at 42, I'm immersed in the world of shell programming, where every line of C code contributes to crafting a robust command-line interface. With a keen eye on project requirements, I embark on the journey of creating a fully functional shell that adheres strictly to guidelines.

Minishell is not just about writing code; it's about understanding the intricacies of shell programming. From presenting prompts and managing command histories to executing commands and handling signals, I delve into every aspect of shell functionality. With each feature I implement, from redirections and pipes to environment variables and built-in commands, I deepen my understanding of how shells interact with the underlying operating system.

The project challenges me to ensure that my shell operates smoothly without unexpected crashes or memory leaks. Adhering to the norm and utilizing the provided external functions, I carefully construct a shell that meets the rigorous standards set forth by 42.

But Minishell is more than just meeting requirements; it's about pushing boundaries and exploring the possibilities of shell scripting. I experiment with different approaches, optimize my code, and strive for elegance in design.

To ensure the reliability and robustness of my shell, I also implement several unit tests. These tests are designed to verify the correctness of individual components of the shell, from simple command executions to complex redirections and signal handling. Unit tests help identify and fix bugs early in the development process, ensuring that each part of the shell functions as intended. By testing edge cases and typical usage scenarios, I can confidently refine my code, knowing that it meets the high standards of functionality and stability expected in a real-world shell environment.

As I navigate through the project, I encounter obstacles and learn valuable lessons along the way. Whether it's implementing redirections, handling environment variables, or understanding signal handling, each challenge brings me one step closer to mastering the art of shell programming.

In the end, Minishell isn't just a projectâ€”it's a testament to my growth as a programmer. It's a command-line companion that I've crafted with care and precision, ready to tackle any task thrown its way.
